			<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#8B4513]">What is Daydream San Francisco?</h2>
			<p>
				This September 27th-28th, we are running <strong>Daydream San Francisco</strong>, a 24-hour
				game jam where 200 of the Bay Area's brightest young minds will gather to create incredible
				video games from scratch.
			</p>
			<p>
				Daydream is a beginner-friendly event designed for high schoolers. It's a space where
				coders, artists, designers, and musicians collaborate in a whirlwind of creativity. As part
				of Hack Club's largest-ever global event, our hackathon will run simultaneously with dozens
				of other Daydreams in cities around the world, from Singapore to London.
			</p>
			<p>
				Daydream is operated by <strong>Hack Club</strong>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that
				empowers over 50,000+ teenagers globally through a network of coding clubs and events. Hack
				Club has a legacy of running ambitious, high-energy events for teens, including a hackathon
				on a train across America.
			</p>
			<h2 class="pt-4 text-3xl font-bold text-[#8B4513]">Our Mission</h2>
			<p>
				Our mission is to empower the next generation of creators in the Bay Area by introducing
				them to game development in a fun, collaborative, and low-stakes environment. We want to
				show them the magic of building something real with a team of their peers. For many,
				Daydream will be their first exposure to the joy of coding and the creative challenges of
				game design.
