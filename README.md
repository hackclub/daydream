# Dear Hackers, Musicians, and Artists,

Welcome to Hack Club's newest adventure. This fall we invite you to join us for Daydream, the world's biggest Game Jam happening simultaneously in 100 cities.

**Hack Club wants you to make a game this fall.**

Don't consider yourself a game dev? No problem - we have tons of online and in-person workshops for you to make your first game!

This fall, we invite you to learn something new, make something you're really proud of, meet new friends, and go on an incredible adventure together.

With love,

*The Daydream Team*
